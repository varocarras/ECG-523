# Classification of Arrhythmia from Raw ECG using Deep Neural Network for Detection and Diagnosis

## TO-DO
- Copy to SCC
- Create train.py module
- Generate new results (comparisons with new data)
- Edit README
- Train on Stanford's Model


# Overview of Included Files

models folder --> Stores the model weights
data --> contains only the MIT-BIH dataset and instructions on how to get the other datasets


# Datasets (Training)
  - MIT-BIH
